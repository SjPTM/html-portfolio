<h1>About Me</h1>
<img src="../assets/images/IMG_2316 (1).jpg" height="300">
<p>🛠️  At present, I'm learning to code for fun. For money, I am designing a 1:x 
  learning experience from scratch for Cloudinary partners. To date, we've launched 
  a new partner portal containing 8 skills courses, a legally defensible certification, along 
  with a dense library of resources and tools to track deals. Providing 
  our partners with the means to confidently implement, integrate, and 
  position Cloudinary's Image and Technology Platform has imparted a 
  depth of knowledge around the value of partnerships and our collective offering.

  🎯  Before joining Cloudinary, I managed a certification program for Simpleview, 
  a software solution company in the travel and tourism sector, developing 4 separate 
  certification exams with corresponding courses. As the program and demand for 
  ertifications grew, I developed a team of designers responsible for creating 120 
  hours+ of online educational content, including "Email Marketing Management for 
  Destination Marketers," "Introduction to the Simpleview CRM," “CRM Meeting Sales,” 
  "Simpleview CMS," “Leadership Advocacy,” and “Data Privacy Training” to further 
  Simpleview’s customer and employee training initiatives.

  🌟 Before expanding into Customer Education, I taught High School English for a decade+.
   My experience in K12 education provided me with the know-how and experience to manage 
   multiple projects at once. Engaging 150+ high school teenagers every single day to shape 
   their educational growth and overall development requires insane project management 
   skills.</p>
