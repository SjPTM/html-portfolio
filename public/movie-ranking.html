<p> a 1999 American psychological thriller film
    written and directed by M. Night Shyamalan. 
    It stars Bruce Willis as a child psychologist 
    whose patient (Haley Joel Osment) claims he can see and 
    talk to the dead. Very few movies can surprise me, 
    yet this nail biter has one of the best endings
    that has stuck with me through the years.
